				Your electrical panel is essentially the control center that takes electricity from the power grid and
				safely routes it to every outlet, switch, and appliance in your home.
			</p>

			<p class="mb-6">
				While this often-overlooked box may be hidden behind decorative covers or tucked away in utility areas,
				it plays a critical role in fire prevention and electrical safety. A compromised panel—whether affected
				by rust, physical damage, or improper installations like double-tapped breakers—creates serious safety
				hazards that put your property and occupants at risk.

							Critical Safety Information
						</h3>
						<p class="text-red-700">
							Circuit breakers in electrical panels serve as critical safety devices, protecting both the
							electrical system and occupants from dangerous conditions. When a short circuit or overload
							occurs in any circuit, the breaker automatically trips, immediately cutting power to the
							affected line and preventing potential hazards like electrical fires or electrocution.
